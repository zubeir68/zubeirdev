              <p>Hi, my name is Zubeir Mohamed I am a Data Science and AI Student and Intern as a Software Developer. I started coding {{moment-from-now '2017-08-01'}} and felt in love ever since. My goal is to impact peoples life by solving problems through software and reach the full potential of my creativity. My hobbies are building apps and playing basketball. I mostly use JavaScript for both backend and frontend with React or Ember.js as frameworks but I also like Java and C#. If you want to network and reach out to me, just go to the <a href="/">Home</a> Page and use any social-link you like. LET'S CONNECT ðŸ˜„</p>
