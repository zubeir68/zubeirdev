    Hi, my name is Zubeir Mohamed I am a Data Science and AI Student at Saarland University and Intern as a
    Software Engineer at Software AG. I
    started coding {{moment-from-now "2017-08-01"}} and felt in love ever since. My goal is to impact peoples
    life by solving problems through software and reach the full potential of my creativity. My hobbies are
    building apps and playing basketball. I mostly use JavaScript for both backend and frontend with React or
    Ember.js as frontend-frameworks but I also like to Java and C#. If you want to network and reach out to me,
    just go to
